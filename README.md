# Diff
Diff (diff.wikimedia.org) is a blog by and for the Wikimedia volunteer community to connect and share learnings, stories, and ideas from across our movement.

The maintenance and support of Diff is facilitated by the Communications team at the Foundation with dedicated staff to support the editorial process. We plan to present Diff to all community-facing teams, and we are looking forward to hearing your feedback and suggestions. If you have any questions or ideas for something you'd like to share, please let us know.

## Architecture
Diff is hosted on WordPress VIP.

Diff uses a WordPress theme called "Interconnection." It is designed by hang Do Thi Duc and follows the Wikimedia Design (https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/) and branding (https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Brand) style guides. Development of Interconnection is handled in [the theme's own repository, wikimedia/interconnection-wordpress-theme](https://github.com/wikimedia/interconnection-wordpress-theme).

Diff uses the following plugins:

* Polylang for translation
* PublishPress for editoral workflow
* wpDiscuz for comments
* Co-Authors Plus for authorship
* Fieldmanager to assist media attribution
* The Events Calendar for event coordination
* Diff customizations for small tweaks to the editing interface to help new folks

## Local development environment setup

### These guides may be useful

- https://dev.hmn.md/2023/01/25/steps-to-create-a-vip-local-env-that-uses-docker/

### Note
Node version > 18 is needed by VIP dev-env - some engineers reported problems starting the environment and importing the database with prior versions of Node.

### Summarized step-by-step after installing VIP dev-env
- Clone Wikimedia Diff repo, copy its location
- Most dependencies for the diff.wikimedia.org site are managed using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). After cloning the repository, run
```
composer install
```
to pull down the plugins and themes necessary to run the Diff site.
- Creating the local environment using VIP dev-env:
```
nvm use 18
vip dev-env create --slug=diff --media-redirect-domain=blog-wikimedia-org-develop.go-vip.net
```
   - *WordPress site title*: "Wikimedia Diff Local Environment"
   - *Multisite*: Select "No", Wikimedia Diff is a single site which uses Polylang instead of MLP
   - *PHP version to use*: Select "8.1" - Some errors starting WordPress where reported when selecting versions higher than 8.0
   - *WordPress*: Select the same version of WordPress running on production. To figure it out, open [http://diff.wikimedia.org](http://diff.wikimedia.org) and look for the tag `<meta name="generator" content="WordPress VERSION_NUMBER" />` on the source code.
   - *How would you like to source vip-go-mu-plugins*: Select "Demo" for automatically fetched vip-go-mu-plugins
   - *How would you like to source application-code*: Select "Custom" and paste the location where you cloned Wikimedia Diff repo.
   - *Enable Elasticsearch*: Select "No"
   - *Enable phpMyAdmin*: Select "No"
   - *Enable XDebug*: Select "Yes"
   - *Enable MailHog*: Select "No"
   - Note: The `--media-redirect-domain` argument will proxy requests for missing local images to the dev environment. This way you can quickly get your local running, and use media locally as expected, without having to download a large file export from the VIP dashboard.
- Start your environment using `vip dev-env start --slug=diff`

You should now be able to visit [diff.vipdev.lndo.site](http://diff.vipdev.lndo.site/) and see a basic WordPress install.

### Importing database

The most straightforward way to populate your local site with real content is to use the VIP dev-env `sync` command.

```
vip dev-env sync sql @blog-wikimedia-org.production --slug=diff
```

Assuming you have VIP CLI access to the production site, this will pull the latest database backup from production and adapt it for use in your local environment.

If you do not have CLI access to the VIP environment, request a database backup from another project member and follow the steps in the collapsed section immediately below.

<details>

<summary>Alternative steps to manually download and localize the database</summary>

- Start downloading latest media backup from [VIP Dashboard](https://dashboard.wpvip.com/apps/1309/production/data/media/backups) as it may take a while to finish
- Download latest production database backup from [VIP Dashboard](https://dashboard.wpvip.com/apps/1309/production/data/database/backups)
- Extract, rename your production database to `database.sql` and copy it to the project's root directory

> ⚠️ **Note on potential database import issue**
>
> If you encounter the error `tables without wp_ prefix found`, you can safely remove the lines in your SQL export file which relate to the table `protected_embeds` and then retry the import.

- After manually removing `protected_embeds` table creation and its records from database dump file, import the database using:
```
vip dev-env import sql database.sql --slug=diff --search-replace="diff.wikimedia.org,diff.vipdev.lndo.site"
```

</details>

If everything worked as expected when importing, you now probably have [http://diff.vipdev.lndo.site/](http://diff.vipdev.lndo.site/) up and running with the latest production database, and media should be loading from the Dev site thanks to the `--media-redirect-domain` argument we used before.

If you are **not** seeing images, the dev environment may be out of date with production (or you may be offline). You may always also download media files manually from the [VIP Dashboard](https://dashboard.wpvip.com/apps/1309/production/media/backups).

- Extract your media files on your project root directory.
  - The expected location is `/wp-content/uploads`
- Import media files using `vip dev-env import media ./wp-content/uploads --slug=diff`
- Flush cache and restart your instance
```
vip dev-env exec --slug diff -- wp cache flush
vip dev-env stop --slug diff
vip dev-env stop --slug diff
```
- If media files still aren't available, you may try opening one of those in a new tab and accepting a unsecure connection.
- You should have [http://diff.vipdev.lndo.site/](http://diff.vipdev.lndo.site/) up and running at this moment, have fun!


## Theme Development

### Interconnection theme
To work on the Interconnection theme specifically, you will want to replace the Composer source code package with the actual theme source:
```sh
# Remove the original checkout
rm -rf themes/interconnection
# Re-install using the actual repository source
composer install wikimedia/interconnection-wordpress-theme --prefer-source
```

### Theme Development Workflow

1. Create a PR branch off of the `main` branch in the `wikimedia/interconnection-wordpress-theme` repo.
2. For testing your changes, merge the new PR branch into the theme repository's `develop` branch; the theme will build to the `release-develop` branch automatically.
3. Switch to the `wpcomvip/wikimedia-blog-wikimedia-org` repo and checkout into the `develop` branch.
4. Open the `composer.json` file in the `wpcomvip/wikimedia-blog-wikimedia-org` repo.
5. Under the `require` section, update the `"wikimedia/interconnection-wordpress-theme": "dev-release"` line to use the `release-develop` branch of the theme like this:
   ```json
   "wikimedia/interconnection-wordpress-theme": "dev-release-develop"
   ```
6. Run `composer update wikimedia/interconnection-wordpress-theme --prefer-source` to update the theme in the `composer.lock` file.
7. Commit the `composer.json` and `composer.lock` file changes on the `develop` branch; this step will trigger the development build on VIP.
8. Test your changes on the dev site here: https://blog-wikimedia-org-develop.go-vip.net/.

## Diff Blocks
There is a custom plugin in [client-mu-plugins/diff-blocks](https://github.com/wpcomvip/wikimedia-blog-wikimedia-org/tree/production/client-mu-plugins/diff-blocks) which exposes Diff-specific [Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-block-editor/) blocks and customizations.

Run `npm install` to enable the frontend asset build process. The project currently requires Node v14; if you use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you can run `nvm use` (or `nvm install v14`) in the theme directory to set the correct version.

In the project root directory (the same folder as this README), run

```sh
nvm use
npm install
npm run build
```

These commands will generate the CSS and JS assets in `client-mu-plugins/diff-blocks/` necessary to use that Diff Blocks plugin.

Run `npm install` to enable the frontend asset build process. The theme currently requires Node v14; if you use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you can run `nvm use` (or `nvm install v14`) in the theme directory to set the correct version.

## Testing
When making changes to the site, test that the design and functionality works locally before pushing changes to the `develop` branch for staging verification, and that all key site functions still work as expected. This is a partial list of tests and checks you may want to perform:

- Does the homepage look correct at a variety of screen sizes?
- Does an article page look correct at a variety of screen sizes?
- Does the [calendar](https://diff.wikimedia.org/calendar/) look and function correctly at a variety of screen sizes?
- Does search work?
- Does the language picker work on a multilingual post? ([example](https://diff.wikimedia.org/es/2022/03/17/reservate-la-fecha-y-ayudanos-a-crear-la-wikimania-2022/))
- Do photo credits appear on a post (right above the footer)?
- Can you add multiple authors (via Co-Authors Plus), and do the bylines appear correctly?
- Can you schedule a post (PublishPress) to be published in the future, and does it send an email when the publish time has passed? (This may be difficult to test locally, depending on your environment)

If the local environment passes the majority of the above checks, you may merge your code into `develop` for testing on the remote [staging environment](https://blog-wikimedia-org-develop.go-vip.net/).

## Plugin updates
To update plugins, first run

```
composer update
```

to install available updates for Composer-managed plugins.

You will see [version ranges listed for each dependency in `composer.json`](https://github.com/wpcomvip/wikimedia-blog-wikimedia-org/blob/production/composer.json#L89-L105)—for major version upgrades, you will need to change this number and re-run `composer update plugin/name` to install the newer version. Minor version upgrades should be able to be installed automatically as long as the version constraint for that plugin is sufficiently flexible. As an example, a version preceded by a carat `^` will permit all subsequent minor and patch releases to be installed, but will require manual editing to upgrade to a new major version.

Plugins which do not update when you run `composer update` may also be able to be upgraded using the [VIP Dashboard plugins page](https://dashboard.wpvip.com/apps/1309/production/code/plugins). Click "Create Pull Request" on the outdated plugin, and VIP will attempt to create a pull request on this repository which updates the plugin code. This works for some paid plugins.

A small number of plugins are still managed manually, such as the `wpdiscuz` paid extensions. These must be downloaded manually from the relevant plugin vendor. To upgrade a manual plugin, delete the copy in your local environment, replace it with the folder downloaded from the plugin vendor, and use `git` to commit the changed files.

After committing all relevant plugin updates, test the site locally as detailed above in "Testing" before pushing your changes to the [staging site](https://blog-wikimedia-org-develop.go-vip.net/).

**Pay special attention to any major plugin version updates:** major version updates sometimes alter key functionality, so it is always wise to review the plugin's changelog to check for breaking changes. Also be sure to check your environment's PHP logs to validate that none of the plugin updates cause warnings or fatal errors while browsing the site.

## Production Releases

You may notice that PRs in this repository get created against the `preprod` branch. Unlike the Foundation site this branch does not correspond to a deployed environment, but it is used to gather approved and tested code so that it may be deployed in batches.

This is the expected development flow for a feature:

- Branch is created from the `preprod` branch specific to an issue: `git checkout -b <ticket-number>-feature-short-description preprod`
- Once the feature is ready to test, feature branch is pushed and a PR is opened against `preprod`
- PR goes through code review.
- PR is code-approved, and merged to `preprod`. `preprod` should be merged into `develop` to deploy the approved
    - Note: If a feature needs testing during development, the branch should be manually merged into `develop` as soon as the PR is opened so that it may deploy to the staging site for testing. Changes to the PR should be merged to `develop` whenever they are pushed to ensure the latest version of the feature is deployed to Dev.
- Feature is tested in Develop environment
- Once the feature is approved, **Click the link in the Tip at the top of this README to create a release PR**

All releases should be done by deploying *from* `preprod` *to* `production`. This provides consistency with other Foundation projects and allows a final review of the expected features and bugfixes before they are released.
